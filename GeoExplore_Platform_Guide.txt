1. OVERVIEW
GeoExplore Pro is a high-performance, browser-based GIS (Geographic Information System) tool designed for rapid data visualization, spatial analysis, and location discovery. It integrates modern web technologies (React, Leaflet, Tailwind) with advanced data processing and AI-driven search capabilities.

2. CORE FUNCTIONS & FEATURES

A. MAPPING & NAVIGATION
- Initial Focus: The map starts centered on Israel for immediate regional context.
- Layer Rendering: Supports high-performance rendering of thousands of points using both SVG and Canvas (optional) methods.
- Coordinate Handling: Visualizes overlapping points using a "Concentric Rings" system, ensuring no data point is hidden.

B. DATA IMPORT & EXPORT
- Multi-Format Support: Process GeoJSON, JSON, KML, CSV, and Excel (XLSX/XLS) directly.
- ZIP Processing: Automatically extracts and parses Shapefiles (.shp, .dbf, .prj) from ZIP archives.
- Smart Repair: Includes a "Junk Repair" utility for corrupted ZIP buffers to ensure successful extraction.
- CSV Export: Export any active layer's attribute table to a clean CSV file for external use.

C. LAYER MANAGEMENT
- Visual Controls: Toggle visibility, adjust opacity, and change feature colors in real-time.
- Spatial Zoom: Quickly focus the viewport on the bounds of any specific layer.
- Layer Merging: Merge two layers together with an intelligent de-duplication engine that identifies duplicate geometries and attributes.

D. MANUAL DATA COLLECTION
- Point Dropping: Enter "Edit Mode" to manually place points on the map.
- Schema Inheritance: New points automatically inherit the property structure (columns) of the active layer.
- Priority System: Features include a mandatory "Priority" field with four levels: None, Urgent, Normal, and Low.
- Urgent FX: When a feature is set to "Urgent", the map marker turns Red and performs a pulsing ring animation for 10 seconds.

E. GRID & DENSITY ANALYSIS
- Dynamic Grid: Overlay a 0.5km to 2km grid on any layer to calculate point density.
- Frequency Heatmap: Grid cells colorize based on feature counts (Intensity-based coloring).
- Labeling: Toggle numeric labels inside grid cells for precise count visualization.

F. EXPLORE VIEW (OSM INTEGRATION)
- Global Search: Find any Point of Interest (POI) globally using the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API.
- Area Biasing: Searches are biased toward your current map location for more relevant local results.
- Bulk Import: Add search results to your workspace as new, fully-editable map layers.

G. DATA EXPLORER
- Tabular View: A spreadsheet-style view of all feature attributes.
- Global Search: Filter thousands of rows instantly via attribute keyword search.
- Pagination: High-performance data rendering with paginated navigation (50 items per page).

H. ANALYZE VIEW (INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD)
- Live Filtering: Filter map data based on attribute categories or numerical ranges.
- Numerical Widgets: KPIs (Sum/Avg) and dual-range sliders for number columns.
- Categorical Widgets: Choose from four interactive chart types:
  - Donut Charts: For proportional distribution.
  - Treemaps: For hierarchy and area-based volume.
  - Cluster Bars: For frequency ranking.
  - Column Charts: For vertical comparative analysis.

3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
- UI Framework: React 19.
- Mapping Library: Leaflet (react-leaflet).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- AI/Grounding: Integrated support for Gemini API (Search Grounding).
- Coordinate Reference: Defaulting to WGS84 (lat/lng).

4. USER TIPS
- Click the "Layers" button in the map header to toggle the control panel.
- Use the "Analyze" tab to hide/show specific categories on the map in real-time.
- If a Shapefile fails to upload, ensure it is inside a ZIP with its corresponding .dbf file.
